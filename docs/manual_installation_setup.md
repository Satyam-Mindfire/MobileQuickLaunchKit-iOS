You can find these two independent packages: MQLCore and MQLCoreUI inside the MobileQuickLaunchKit folder

* Go to build phases, Add MobileQuickLaunchKit in Link Binary With Libraries section. You can ignore this step if it is already added.
* Register your App on the Firebase console, download GoogleService-Info.plist file and add it to your project target.
* Open your project configuration: click the project name in the left tree view. Select your app from the TARGETS section, then select the Info tab, and expand the URL Types section.
* Click the + button, and add a URL scheme for your reversed client ID. To find this value, open the GoogleService-Info.plist configuration file, and look for the REVERSED_CLIENT_ID key. Copy the value of that key, and paste it into the URL Schemes box on the configuration page. Leave the other fields untouched.
* Now you can expand the package and access the files inside the package.

## 2. Adding The MQLCore or MQLCoreUI Package to your Project
